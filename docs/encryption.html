                                <p>Oasis uses Firebase for its authentication, database, and hosting services. Because of this,
                                    Firebase is responsible for handling a lot of sensitive data, such as user accounts and
                                    personal data. For this sensitive data, Firebase provides encryption of passwords via
                                    SCrypt as well as
                                    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">encryption in transit and encryption at rest</a>
                                    which prevents those without administrative rights from viewing the content; however, those with administrative rights are
                                    still able to view data stored in the database. Thus, in Oasis, we resolved this issue
                                    by implementing end-to-end encryption for data.
                                </p>

                                    prior to its storage. This was done via a hybrid encryption scheme where each user possesses
                                    one symmetric data key and a pair of asymmetric encryption keys. In this scheme, the
                                    symmetric data key is used to encrypt user data, and the key pair provides a secure way
                                    to share data keys between users. </p>

                                <p>When signing up for Oasis, these keys are randomly generated, and the public key of the paired
                                    keys is stored on firebase. The diagram below illustrates the process of how data keys
                                    are shared between users that are friends.
                                </p>

                                <p> Alice and Bob just became friends. At this moment, they exchange data keys so that they can
                                    view each other’s posts and comments. This happens in the following manner:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Alice reads Bob’s public key from the database (Bob's public key is availble to all
                                            users so that they may send information to Bob only).</li>
                                        <li>Alice encrypts her own data key using Bob's public key.</li>
                                        <li>The encrypted result is stored in the database.</li>
                                        <li>Bob is now able to retrieve Alice’s encrypted data key from firebase.</li>
                                        <li>He decrypts it using his own private key.
                                            <li>Now Bob has Alice’s data key and is able to view data that Alice shares, such
                                                as posts.</li>
                                            <li>In a similar fashion, Bob sends his data key to Alice.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    Note: For each of her friends, Alice encrypts her data key using her friend's public key and stores the encrypted result
                                    in firebase. These encrypted data keys are only viewable by the recipient as they require
                                    the proper private key to decrypt it. Thus, Eve is unable to view Alice's data because
                                    she does not have access to the private keys needed to decipher Alice's encrypted data
                                    keys.
                                </p>

                                <h4 class="block-title">Why Use Hybrid Encryption</h3>
                                    <p> Hybrid encryption was chosen because it scales with the size of the plaform given the
                                        limited storage space of
                                        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Firebase's free plan</a>. Each user has a single data key for sending information
                                        to all other users. As a result, Firebase is only required to store a single copy
                                        of each encrypted data. In contrast to other secure asymmetric encryption schemes,
                                        this prevents the database from being cluttered with multiples copies of each posts
                                        and comments, limiting space usage of Firebase.
                                    </p>

                            <div id="messaging" class="section-block">
                                <p>Note:
                                    <br> Our project does not currently have messaging implemented, however the basic overall
                                    structure on how to add encryption to an existing messaging feature will be outlined
                                    below.
                                </p>
                                <p>For messaging encryption, we chose to use the Signal protocol used in the Signal App. More
                                    information can be found
                                    <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-javascript" target="_blank">here </a>
                                    with regards to that project.</p>
                                <p>We chose this in order to ensure that there was end to end encryption between users messaging
                                    each other. This meant, for encryption, we would keep all the encryption private keys
                                    only on the user’s local storage. Though, this can be modified to make the availability
                                    of private keys more feasible in terms of key storage.</p>
                                <p> I will first explain our understanding the Signal protocol at a fairly high level view, only
                                    going into details when deemed appropriate. Then, I will explain our proposed use of
                                    the Signal protocol and finally end with the necessary infrastructure needed to bring
                                    it all together and integrate Signal into this project.</p>

                                <h3 class="block-title">How Signal Works</h3>
                                <p>There are two people wanting to message each other: Alice and Bob. They need to message securely
                                    in order to keep others from viewing any of their messages in transit or at rest when
                                    stored on the database. Signal requires them to each have the following keys in order
                                    to complete this end to end encryption messaging transaction:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A Public/Private Key Pair (Identity Key Pair)</li>
                                    <li>A PreKey Bundle (Ephemeral Keys aka PreKeys)</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>The Identity Key Pair consists of a public/private key pair that will be unique to each Alice
                                    and Bob. This will be used for each user to send the other messages. This works as asymmetric
                                    encryption normally works: If Bob wants to send a message to Alice, then Bob will need
                                    to have Alice’s Public Key in order to encrypt his message with Alice’s public key. Then,
                                    Alice will use her private key to decrypt the message and read it in plaintext. This
                                    scenario does not include verification that Bob sent the message (no signing of the message’s
                                    ciphertext).
                                </p>
                                <p>This is where part of the PreKey comes into play. The PreKey Pair are one time keys used
                                    for an entire session between Alice and Bob: the PreKey Pair are also a public/private
                                    key pair, however, whoever starts the session will determine whose PreKey will be used
                                    for the session. For example, if Bob starts the session between Alice and him, then Bob’s
                                    PreKey will be used for the remainder of the session’s life until the session is terminated
                                    (This is briefly explained in the Signal Documentation).</p>
                                <p>The purpose of the PreKey Pair is to add another level of security in the session between
                                    each pair of users. For example, when Bob sends a message to Alice for the first time,
                                    he must first establish a session with Alice. This will requrie the following:</p>
                                <p>Bob will go to a Key Distribution Center (a Database of public keys of all users available
                                    to all users, this does not require the actual user Bob to actually see all these keys;
                                    this part can be abstracted away to the developer’s liking) and retrieve Alice’s Public
                                    Key Bundle. The PreKey Bundle will include:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Alice’s public Identity Key</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Alice’s registration ID (which is just a random number needed to be generated by the developer in the implementation at the
                                        moment when Alice’s Identity Key Pair is generated; this will be used as a sort of
                                        ‘seed’ to generate the Identity Key Pair for each user)
                                    </li>
                                    <li> PreKey:
                                        <ol type="a">
                                            <li>Key ID: To be used as a way to refer to this unique PreKey for this user</li>
                                            <li>The Public Key for this PreKey Pair</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Signed PreKey:
                                        <ol type="a">
                                            <li>Key ID: To be used as a way to refer to this unique Signed PreKey for this user</li>
                                            <li>The Public Key for this Signed PreKey Pair</li>
                                            <li>The Signature of the Signed PreKey: To be used to verify by Bob that any received
                                                message actually came from Alice</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Once Bob has Alice’s PreKey Bundle/Public Key Bundle, he will use this in order to begin
                                    a session with Alice. (For specifics on the how to start a Session, please refer to the
                                    Signal Documentation).
                                </p>
                                <p>Now that Bob has a session started with Alice, he can now send encrypted messages to Alice
                                    and likewise, Alice will send encrypted messages to Bob using his PreKey Bundle. Once
                                    a session is established however, each of their public keys are stored within the session,
                                    so they do not have to retrieve the PreKey Bundle each time from the database.</p>

                                <p>For our proposed implementation, we chose to have the session information stored on the client
                                    side. The session does not store any message text or ciphertext, so the developer must
                                    decide where to securely store the messages’ text. An issue arises with this because
                                    in order for each user to retain a log of the previously sent and received messages in
                                    this session, they must store a copy on their side. An idea we had was that we could
                                    store the message log on each client’s local storage using the current client’s public
                                    key, that way the client could decrypt the messages when their session is restored (this
                                    would allow for the client to store the messages elsewhere also, since only the client
                                    has access to their own private key to decrypt the message/thread log). For example,
                                    if Bob has sent Alice multiple messages and they have been messaging back and forth,
                                    then Alice and Bob must somehow retain a copy of their conversation. This is required
                                    for the purpose of the UI: each user will need to have a copy of the thread (messages
                                    between Alice and Bob) in order to be able to display to each user the history of the
                                    messages sent to and from one another. They cannot share a common thread storage in plaintext
                                    because the thread should remain encrypted so others will not be able to read it. This
                                    either requires them to share a key that will be used to decrypt the messages thread
                                    or they each need to retain of the messages in realtime. We chose the latter for simplicity.
                                    Also note, that each user will retain the private key counterpart to each public key
                                    that is put into the Key Distribution Center. Also note that each PreKey should only
                                    be used per session; this means that a PreKey is used for each session they have with
                                    themselves and others. If Alice talks with Bob and Eve in separate threads (and therefore
                                    separate sessions), then Bob and Eve should each have a unique PreKey to give to Alice
                                    to use when she retrieves their PreKey Bundles. This results in Bob and Eve having to
                                    manage the distribution of their PreKeys given out to other users so that each of them
                                    will know which private PreKey to refer to (using the key ID) when they are sent a message
                                    by Alice. This is all that is required for them to message each other. If this seem simple
                                    to you, please note that you might face issues, or, rather obstacles, with regard to
                                    how and where keys are stored. Please follow encryption best practices when choosing
                                    where to store each user’s private keys.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>When we chose to store a user’s private keys on their local storage, we faced a problem
                                        that a user must have multiple private keys for each device they use to message from
                                        because the local storage would either have to travel with the user’s account somehow
                                        or they would not have access to those private keys from another device. For example,
                                        if Bob has his stored sessions information and all his private keys on his phone,
                                        then when he tries to send messages through his laptop, he will no longer have access
                                        to that information. A proposed solution was to somehow be able to migrate this information
                                        to other devices via bluetooth or some other form of communication. Or, somehow integrate
                                        a key management service to store them in a cloud so that users have access to their
                                        own private keys anywhere they go, no matter the device. This does not seem to be
                                        safe, since now the security of their private keys are delegated to a third party.
                                        However, if the user loses the device where their private keys are stored (when using
                                        local storage), then we also face the problem of them losing the ability to retrieve
                                        any past messages they received or sent. This is something that future developers
                                        will need to handle.

                                    <li>The Signal protocol is dependent on having a good processor and browser support in order
                                        to carry out the encryption. This means that the protocol will only be available
                                        in certain versions of browsers, which will require careful limitations for future
                                        developers when releasing this application</li>
